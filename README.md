# Mission-to-Mars
  Challenge 10

## Project Overview
We are helping Robin develop a web app called, "Mission to Mars", where she tracks facts and information about Mars. We gathered the data by web scraping different websites to pull the data into her website. So far we have news articles, images, and fun facts; now she wants to include images of Mar's hemispheres. We used Beautiful Soup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images and titles, store the scraped data on a Mongo database and use html to display to the data. Images of the created web app are shown below.
As shown in the image below, the web page has a title and button called "Scrape New Data" to pull-in the newest data from the sites we are scrapping. Below that is the data that has been scraped. The newest Mars news article from NASA, a featured image of Mars, and facts about Mars.

As you scroll down the web app, you find 4 photos of the 4 hemispheres and their titles.

Additionally, Robin wants to make sure her app is functional on mobile devices. The html code was modified to fit and function well on different screens. As shown, the sizing and ease of the website changes on the smaller devices.
